# Twitter-Data-Mining-Project
To showcase my abilities in R and Tableau, I downloaded hundreds of Elon Musk's tweets, cleaned the data and ran a series of queries on the data to identify trends hidden in the data.



**Cleaning the Tweets**
Before I could begin my analysis of the data, I needed to clean out all of the extraneous data that came along with the tweets. 

Mined data will often come with extraneous information that must be removed from the dataset in order to draw accurate conclusions. To do this, I used a series of Regex commands to remove various artifacts left by the Twitter API.
